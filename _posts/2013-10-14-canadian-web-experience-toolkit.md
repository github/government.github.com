Government websites often share many of the same basic requirements such as usability, accessibility, and interoperability. Rather than reinvent the wheel each time, the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada developed the [Web Experience Toolkit](http://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew) to create a set of shared templates for all government websites.

After extensive user testing, this mobile-first, multilingual framework can be completely customized for any government use case. As project lead Paul Jackson remarked during [a recent webinar](http://www.howto.gov/training/classes/canada-web-experience-toolkit), "It actually became much easier for everyone to meet their requirements and a lot less costly by everyone pooling their resources into a common solution that everyone could repurpose." Even [the documentation itself](http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html) is open source and collaborative using GitHub Pages.

Today, with nearly 300 forks, and almost 100 members, the [award-winning](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/wiki/Accolades#wiki-Awards) Web Experience Toolkit has been translated to more than 30 languages and is one of, if not the most active government open source projects. Members of the public and government employees from any agency are encouraged to provide feedback or submit contributions at any time. As Jackson noted, "It's all free. It's a community resources... there's no request for any funds to do any work.

Interested in using the Web Experience Toolkit for your next government site? Simply [download the latest release](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/releases). The toolkit is both W3C and WCAG standards-compliant and has been adapted for use with [Drupal](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-drupal), [SharePoint](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-sharepoint), [Jekyll](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-jekyll), [PHP](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-php), [SSI](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-ssi) and [Wordpress](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-wordpress). You can see it featured, for example, on the [Canadian Open Data portal](http://www.data.gc.ca/eng), and with [over 3,000 issues under its belt](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues?state=open), it's showing no signs of slowing down.
